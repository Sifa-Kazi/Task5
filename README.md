## Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objective

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and understand relationships between variables using Python.

### Dataset Used

Titanic Dataset from kaggle

### Steps Performed

1. Loaded the dataset and checked basic info (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`).
2. 
3. Explored categorical variables using `value_counts()` and visualizations.
4. 
5. Plotted:
   - Histogram (Age distribution)
   - Boxplot (Fare distribution)
   - Countplot (Survival by Gender)
   - Scatterplot (Age vs Fare by Survival)
   - Pairplot (numeric relationships)
   - Heatmap (correlation)
6. Wrote observations for each visualization.
   
7. Summarized key findings in a final summary.
